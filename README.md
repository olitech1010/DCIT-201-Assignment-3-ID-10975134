# THE QUESTION
Exercise 3
Create a Java class BankAccount that has the following attributes:
•	accountNumber (a string)
•	balance (a double)

The class should have the following methods:
•	deposit(double amount): This method should allow the user to deposit money into their account. It should add the amount to the balance and return the new balance.
•	withdraw(double amount): This method should allow the user to withdraw money from their account. If the amount is greater than the balance, it should return an error message "Insufficient balance". Otherwise, it should subtract the amount from the balance and return the new balance.
•	getBalance(): This method should return the current balance.
You should also write a Main class that creates two BankAccount objects and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.



Create a Java class Circle that has the following attributes:
•	radius (a double)
•	The class should have the following methods:
•	getArea(): This method should return the area of the circle, which is calculated as π * radius^2.
•	getCircumference(): This method should return the circumference of the circle, which is calculated as 2 * π * radius.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Circle objects, sets their radius, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
•	Create a Java class Person with the following attributes:
•	name (a string)
•	age (an int)
•	address (a string)
The class should have the following methods:
 • getName(): This method should return the name of the person.
 • getAge(): This method should return the age of the person.
 • getAddress(): This method should return the address of the person.
 • setAddress(String address): This method should set the address of the person.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Person objects, sets their attributes, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
•	Create a Java class Car with the following attributes:
•	make (a string)
•	model (a string)
•	year (an int)
•	speed (a double)
The class should have the following methods:
•	getMake(): This method should return the make of the car.
•	getModel(): This method should return the model of the car.
•	getYear(): This method should return the year of the car.
•	getSpeed(): This method should return the speed of the car.
•	accelerate(): This method should increase the speed of the car by 10 mph.
•	brake(): This method should decrease the speed of the car by 7 mph.
You should also write a Main class that creates two Car objects, sets their attributes, and demonstrates the use of each of the methods.
